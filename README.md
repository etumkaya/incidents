### About the Project

San Francisco and Chicago are two mega cities in the US, and as in any large city, crime is a significant problem that requires thorough analysis. This project will focus on exploring the relationships between selected features and incident counts in both cities. The ultimate goal is to train efficient machine learning algorithms to explain the variation in crime counts separately for both cities. Afterwards, the results will be compared.

The main datasets are from Chicago's and San Francisco's open data portals. Additionally, other datasets will be utilized to create additional features such as daily and hourly temperature, precipitation, moon status, etc.

Exploring the data will involve utilizing exploratory machine learning models with appropriate parameters, validation techniques, and a variety of statistical tests.

*** I've started this project on the beginning of April 24. My proposal where I explained what I am going to do can be found on this repository.
