    "\n",
    "San Francisco and Chicago are two mega cities in the US, and as in any large city, crime is a significant problem that requires thorough analysis. This project will focus on exploring the relationships between selected features and incident counts in both cities. The ultimate goal is to train efficient machine learning algorithms to explain the variation in crime counts separately for both cities. Afterwards, the results will be compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main datasets are from Chicago's and San Francisco's open data portals. Additionally, other datasets will be utilized to create additional features such as daily and hourly temperature, precipitation, moon status, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the data will involve utilizing exploratory machine learning models with appropriate parameters, validation techniques, and a variety of statistical tests. "

I will calculate the hourly averages for the hours with rain and also the hours without rain. I will visualize my findings. Most importantly, I will perform statistical tests to see if I can reject my null hyphothesis.\n",

My initial approach will be to try tree based algorithms due to the fact that I have many categorical features which I will encode. I know that they are also good at capturing complex relations. I am planning on starting with a decision tree implementation, then try random forest or gradient boosting to see if they can improve the performance. I will be cautious to address the issue of overfitting when especially trying the latter algorithms. It is important to note that this model will be a predictive one. My main purpose will be to approach the right crime counts for the respected hour.            \n",

    "\n",
    "I am planning on doing Monte-Carlo Validation. This will help me form a confidence intervals for my R^2.

It is important to note that I will try different methods as well.  \n",

    "### Final Goal\n",

    "I will build models for both cities individualy and they will give me a clear idea on which features were more important, which were only important for one city and not the other, along with the ones which were not important at all. Moreover, for the predictive model, I will asses the metrics of my regression (R^2, RMSE, MSE) and do a comparision for both model performances.  \n",
